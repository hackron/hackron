What We Value
=============

We hackronites set out to create a space for like minded individuals. Along the
way, we've been able to write down what that means:

- Come to Hackron to work and to collaborate. Feel free to choose who you work
  with, but do not be surprised if others start similar projects. Forking and
  imitation are gestures of love: you own your work, not your ideas.
