These are the minutes of Hackron.

How to hold a meeting
=====================

Our meetings are complicated. Sorry about that. We're building some robots to help with that.

It is split up into more components than needed. If you've got any ideas to make it simpler, please submit a pull request :)

The Schedule
------------

Meetings are held in meatspace and online every Thursday at 7:00 PM.

Meatspace: OSC Tech Lab at 12 E. Exchange St, Akron, Ohio.
Online: Check out the pinned thread in the [meetings category on discourse](http://discuss.hackron.org/category/meetings). It gets updated with a google hangout link.

Minutes
-------

Meeting minutes are kept in github at [hackron/hackron](http://github.com/hackron/hackron) under minutes/. There should already be a file there with the meeting's date. If not, prepare the agenda as the instructions in TEMPLATE.md say. It contains important steps regarding how to notify folks and keep us all in the loop.

The purpose of the agenda is to make sure we remember what we're discussing that week when Thursday comes around, so add any items to it you'd like to see.

For taking minutes, please use an etherpad from [pad.riseup.net](https://pad.riseup.net/). Copy the minutes into that document and share the link via Slack and Discourse. All attendees are encouraged to join and contribute. As others type, feel free to make any corrections or keep track of the discussion stack.
