Temporary Hackron Bylaws
========================

This document will remain in effect until it is superseded by a group-ratified
bylaws document.

It outlines the decision making and basic structure of the organization.

The goal of this document is to facilitate short-term progress whilst
alleviating awkwardness associated with questions regarding "who is wearing the
pants".

The Meat and Potatos
====================

* Decisions made at weekly group meetings are put into effect immediately unless
  otherwise specified and apply to the whole group.
* For decisions made at weekly meetings, there must be three members present to
  establish a quorum
* If you were absent from a meeting and have concerns with a decision that was
  made there, show up next week and it to the agenda.
* Decisions made in the process of completing action items from a weekly meeting
  should generally be considered equivalent to those made in weekly meetings.
* When possible, we will follow the Fractal Working Groups factory pattern as
  documented by Noisebridge with the goal of distributing work and reducing our
  collective bus factor.
